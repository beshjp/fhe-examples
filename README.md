# Exploring Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and its applications, particularly in machine learning. I will primarily be using the the `concrete` and `concrete-ml` libraries by [Zama](zama.ai).
